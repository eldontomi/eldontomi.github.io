<h3> don't miss the forest for the trees (a.k.a. real macro thinking) </h3>
<h4> [wip] </h4>
<p><i>on finding inflection points; geopolitics/technological disruption; difficulty of conviction</i>></p>

<p>In autumn 2023, I was sitting in the office of the head of a successful up and coming global macro hedge-fund, when I asked about some Asian carry trade that they may have been involved in. Rather than getting the validation from this exotic options fund manager, I was met with a retort that I think about now on an almost daily basis. It was something along the lines of: 
  <i>"You're interested in global macro. That's great! But you're a Stanford computer science student in 2023. Druckenmiller isn't up this year because of niche carry trades, it's because they fucking bought NVIDIA! That's global macro. Don't miss the fucking forest for the trees".</i>

  </p>

<p>Obviously, in this anecdote and to this fund manager, the forest was AI and compute. But the pastoral message of that retort are that good, long-term macro thinking is often seduced and murdered by the allure of the sexy idea, and the desire to feel smart and signal that you are smart - but you can risk missing the forest.
As people like Peter Thiel and Jeremy Giffon have noted, the best trade in the last decade was holding onto FAAMGs only. But many people didn't do this, because conviction is hard. But this is not an essay about [[Essay - Portfolio Building]], nor [[On Conviction]], it's about seeking to clarify what the forests are in which I believe I should and can excel and build in.
</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, I believe there are two forests that define, at minimum, the next decade:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the technological disruption primarily wrought by increased demand/capability for compute, sophisticated agent and large-language models, improved energy technology (cheap renewables, batteries), and global availability of high-latency telecommunications    </li>
    <li>increased international autarky and de-globalisation and resultant increased volatility (in energy, food, security, and transportation)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The ways I have spent my free time (and my studies) in the last four years have largely derived from these two verticals. In the latter case, reading a lot of [[People - Zoltan Poszar]] reports, and asking the question of who captures the most upside from volatility created my interest in physical commodity traders (and Latin America, which I believe is also well positioned). While working at Trafigura, and after, I have always been primed with the question of how cheap and ubiquitous compute/renewable energy changes this? 
</p>

<p>
It is important to caveat the danger of the forest - it's a hammer which can make everything look like a nail. That being said, these are two forests that are highly interconnected. Take for instance the enormous recent success of European power traders. The increasing lucrative nature of arbitraging power has been enabled largely by increased volatility in energy prices, which itself is a function of intermittency of green energy sources and geopolitical instability, but also the software stack that makes algorithmic detection and execution of these opportunities feasible.
