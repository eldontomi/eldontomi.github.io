    <p>some things i'm thinking about at the moment</p>


<ul>
    <li><b>if the world gets more volatile, who wins and how?</b> zoltan, energy, food, geopolitics, nearshoring, physical arbitrageurs, providers of compute...</li>

    <li><b>why the metropolis x sp deal is fascinating</b> "reverse verticalisation", "ai rollups", and creating operating leverage at scale</li>

    <li><b>the right model for investing in idiosyncratic risk environments</b> </li>

    <li><b>where can you replicate the european model of power traders?</b> </li>

    <li><b>how do you build an asset intensive business from scratch?</b> </li>

    <li><b>what does the right portfolio look like?</b>  there's a strong argument for just having 6ish things in your portfolio. Some variation of Microsoft/Apple/Google/Meta, Bitcoin, maybe some uncorrelated legal/special sits fund, and then dedicating all your new time (not spent reading decks or talking to lawyers or worrying about altering your portfolio) to building a sizeable business yourself over a decade plus. </li>

    <li><b>how can you maximise your own agency?</b> There are some evident patterns in successful people: being prodigious in certain fields, those fields being high leverage ones, and having a prolific volume of output. But most important is the "force of nature" element: for a skilled politician it might just be the gravitas and charisma with which they can work a room, for Napoleon it meant a ceaseless energy for creating institutions and building legacy, for Sam Altman it may be some combination of asking the right questions, execution, and being in the rooms with the right people. "How alive are you willing to be" - some people are more *alive* than others. For Rick Rubin this means having more open and calibrated antennae to all the stimulus of the world; to others it can be a restless desire to build and act. </li>
</ul>
